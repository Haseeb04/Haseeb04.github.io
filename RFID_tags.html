                RFID (radio frequency identification) allows data to be transmitted wirelessly over radio waves.
            </p1>
            <p3>
                There are two parts to an RFID system: a tag and a reader. Use of radio signals means that the system does not require a line of sight between the tag and the reader.

                            RFID tags are made up of an antenna, for receiving and trasmitting the radio frequency signals, and a chip which processes the signals. Each tag has a unique identifier and will often store some additional data in a non-volatile memory cell.

                                    1) They can be incorporated into tiny sticky "labels' that can be concealed within products or
                                    inserted into chunky plastic enclosures that can be attached to items for sale

                                    2) They are often embedded in employee and student ID cards that are used to open doors and
                                    car park barriers

                                    or required to have their pets tagged for identification purposes; a tiny tag, the size of a mobile
                                    phone SIM card, is inserted into the fleshy part of the pet's neck and can be read by a handheld
